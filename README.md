# lspdfr-folder-switch
This is kind of a niche script i made for my particular situation. I play a mod for GTA5 called LSPDFR, and have 3 folders, one for LSPDFR, one for online (so no mods), and one modded story mode.

This script automatically renames the folders to easily switch between which installation you want to use.

# How to use
Firstly, you must have your installs named in this scheme:
![Naming scheme](https://i.vgy.me/L689Ex.png "Naming Scheme")

In this screenshot, the one named Grand Theft Auto V is my clean install with no mods.

Next, all you have to do is run the python file, select the folder containing your GTA folders, and let it go to work!

# Notes
I will note that this was made for my steam install(s), so it may not work for Epic or Rockstar installs, i haven't tested it yet.

This is also assuming you only have 3 folders, if you have multiple modded folders, the script may name them all to "GTAV - Modded".

This is made for windows.
